# Samba

Samba is a tool that allows sharing of Linux resources such as file & printers to other operating systems.

#It work exactly like NFS(Network File System) but difference is NFS shares within linux or unix like system whereas Samba shares with other Operating System.Eg:Windows, Mac etc.

Samba shares its filesystem through a protocol called 'SMB'.

Another protocol used to share Samba is through 'CIFS'.

If computer 'A' shares its filesystem with computer 'B' using  Samba , then computer 'B' will see that shared filesystem as if it is mounted as the local filesystem.
